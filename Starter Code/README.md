# Starter Template for Shiny Apps
This is a starter template for anyone who wants to start using Shiny but wants a different look to their Shiny App beyond what is shown in Shiny Gallery (all white backgrounds).

The code has the libraries and code needed to start selecting your theme. 
Custom fonts are also possible, select a font you want, download it and save it to your computer's font book.
